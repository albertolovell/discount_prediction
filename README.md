# discount_prediction

The goal of this project is to formulate a problem, devise an approach, conduct experiments, and present findings to a general
educated audience. The data accompanying this repo includes about 130,000 sales transactions. 
The goal is to train one or more machihne learning models that will predict
the discount on the item price as accurately as 
possible. Our main task is to (1) analyze the data to get a good understanding of it, perhaps pitfalls to
        avoid, recognize outliers, or find errors
    (2) choose and execute a machine learning approach to tackle the problem,
    (3) come up with success metrics,
    (4) prepare to present the results including your limitations and future
        directions.
