# discount_prediction

The goal of this study is to train one or more machine learning models that will predict the discount on the price of a line item as accurately as
possible. The data accompanying this repo includes about 130,000 sales transactions.

Our main tasks are:

(1) analyze our data to get a good understanding, discovering pitfalls to avoid, recognizing outliers, or finding errors

(2) choose and execute a machine learning approach to tackle the problem

(3) establish evaluation metrics

(4) present the results including limitations and future directions.
